# MDP_Grid_World
Solution to the MDP problem for a generic grid world (figure 17.1 AIMA Textbook page 646)

Write a program to define a MDP problem for a generic grid world (e.g. figure 17.1 of AIMA
textbook page 646 ) and use value iteration to print the values of states in each iteration. The
description of MDP (T, R, gamma, and epsilon) should be loaded from the text file as input.
